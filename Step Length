Step Length = 2 sqe lh-h^2 (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096663620200190X )

In this equation, h is equal to the change in height of the CoM, and l equals pendulum length. 
Changes in vertical position were calculated by a double integration of Y. 
To avoid integration drift, position data were high-pass filtered (fourth-order zero-lag Butterworth filter at 0.1 Hz).
The amplitude of changes in vertical position (h) was determined as the difference between highest and
lowest position during a step cycle. Leg length was taken as pendulum length (l). 
From these data, step lengths were estimated.
After step lengths were estimated for 20 subsequent steps, a mean step length was calculated. 
From the same 20 steps, mean step duration was calculated. For each subject 
and each belt speed condition, mean step length divided by mean step duration was used to estimate walking speed.
